Solar energy is one of the most popular renewable energy sources on the planet, and its popularity is growing. The current study predicts the production of horizontal photovoltaics installed in 12 places across the northern hemisphere. Without irradiance information, just location and weather data are used. While irradiance is a good predictor of solar power generation, gathering this data about a site can be time-consuming, and estimations can be inaccurate. As a result, the capacity to predict power production without irradiance data needs to be investigated further in order to save time, effort, and money while maintaining accuracy.

# Dataset
The data is publicly available on Kaggle and consists of 14 months of power output, location, and weather data. The remaining sections will cover data processing, modeling, results, and conclusions.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset consists of 21,045 rows and 17 columns. Letâ€™s explore the available columns in the dataset using functions in pandas- Python data analysis library.
